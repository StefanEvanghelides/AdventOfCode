# AdventOfCode
My solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles.

I try to implement them in C++ and/or Python. Perhaps later in other languages as well.

Python runs out of the box. I have Python version 3.10 installed on my system, but I didn't use any specific feature of latest versions, so most likely any Python 3 version works.

For C++, I am running it on Windows, using the latest MinGW g++ compiler (9.2.0, downloaded somewhere in 2021). C++ standard 2020. To execute these programs, I take the default make and run batches, copy-paste them into the desired cpp folder and then simply compile and run the code using `make main-a.cpp && run` (or `main-b.cpp`).
